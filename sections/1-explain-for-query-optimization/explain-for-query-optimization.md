# Understanding MySQL Query Plans

## üîπ Why MySQL Creates a Query Plan Before Each Query

### üî∏ What‚Äôs a Query Plan?
A query plan is a step-by-step strategy chosen by the MySQL query optimizer for how it will execute a SQL query.

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE city = 'London';
```
Before running this, MySQL considers:
- Do I have an index on the `city` column?
- Is it better to scan the whole table or use the index?
- How many rows am I likely to return?

These questions help MySQL decide the most efficient way to run the query.

### üî∏ Why Is This Important?
Databases can produce the same result using different methods, but some are much faster. The query plan affects:
- Execution time
- CPU usage
- Disk I/O

---

## üîπ What Does EXPLAIN Do?

The statement:
```sql
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM orders WHERE customer_id = 5;
```
- Does **not** execute the query.
- Shows how MySQL plans to execute it.

It reveals:
- Whether it will use an index
- What type of join it will use
- How many rows it thinks it will process

This helps you identify slow parts of a query before running it.

## üîπ Key Concepts Explained

### üî∏ Full Table Scan
MySQL reads every row in the table, checking if it matches the WHERE clause.

- ‚úÖ OK for small tables
- ‚ùå Bad for large tables

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department = 'Sales';
```
If there's no index on `department`, this will be a full table scan.

---

### üî∏ Index Access

Indexes help MySQL find rows faster.

#### 1. Covering Index
If the index has all the necessary data:
- ‚úÖ Best-case scenario
- No need to read the actual table

**Example:**
```sql
-- Composite index on (first_name, last_name)
SELECT first_name, last_name FROM employees WHERE first_name = 'John';
```
If the index contains all selected columns, MySQL can answer the query from the index alone.

#### 2. Index Lookup + Table Access
The index is used to filter rows, then the table is accessed for additional data.

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT salary FROM employees WHERE first_name = 'John';
```
If the index is on `first_name`, MySQL finds matching rows using the index, then fetches `salary` from the table.

### üî∏ Trade-Offs

If many rows are selected, jumping between index and table can be slower than a full scan. The optimizer chooses the lowest cost option based on:
- Table size
- Row estimates
- Index availability
- Requested columns

## üîπ Tools for Analysis

### üî∏ EXPLAIN
**Syntax:**
```sql
EXPLAIN  SELECT * FROM CITY WHERE NAME = 'London';
```
- Shows expected execution plan
- Safe to run (no data is modified)

### üî∏ EXPLAIN ANALYZE (MySQL 8+)
**Syntax:**
```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM CITY WHERE NAME = 'London';
```
- Actually runs the query and shows what MySQL expected vs. what happened
- ‚ö†Ô∏è For `DELETE`, `UPDATE`, or `INSERT`, it will change data

**Examples:**
```sql
EXPLAIN DELETE FROM city;           -- Safe, only shows the plan
EXPLAIN ANALYZE DELETE FROM city;   -- Dangerous, will actually delete rows!
```

### üî∏ Optional Formats: FORMAT=...
MySQL supports output formatting:
```sql
EXPLAIN FORMAT=JSON SELECT * FROM orders;
```
- TRADITIONAL (default): table format
- JSON: most detailed
- TREE: good for visualizing plan hierarchy

üí° **Tip:** Use `FORMAT=JSON` for automation or deeper stats.
