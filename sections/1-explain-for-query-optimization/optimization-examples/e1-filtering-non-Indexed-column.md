# üîπ Query Example1: Filtering on a Non-Indexed Column
> ‚ÄúWe will execute a simple `SELECT` on the `city` table with a condition on a non-indexed column called `name`.‚Äù

```sql
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM CITY WHERE NAME = 'London';
```

> so the result set will be :

| select_table | table | partitions | **type** | possible_key | key_len | ref    | rows | filtered | extra      | 
|:------------:|:------|:----------:|:--------:|:------------:|:-------:|:------:|------|:--------:|:----------:|
| SIMPLE       | CITY  | `NULL`     |  **ALL** | `NULL`       | `NULL`  | `NULL` | 4046 | 10.00    | Using where|



- name is not indexed
- Therefore, MySQL cannot use an index to quickly locate the matching row(s)
- It must scan all rows

### üî∏ Result:
#### ‚û°Ô∏è Full Table Scan (Access Type = ALL)

## üîπ Understanding Access Types in EXPLAIN
> ‚ÄúThe table access types show whether a query accesses the table using an index scan‚Ä¶‚Äù

The **Access Type** (in `EXPLAIN`) tells you how MySQL reads data from the table.


| Access Type      | Meaning                                 | Cost          |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------- | --------------|
| `ALL`            | Full Table Scan                         | ‚ùå High      | 
| `index`          | Full Index Scan                         | Moderate      |
| `range`          | Range scan using index (e.g., `>`, `<`) | ‚úÖ Good      |
| `ref` / `eq_ref` | Index Lookup by equality                | ‚úÖ Very Good |
| `const`          | Query matches a single row              | ‚úÖ Best      |
| `system`         | Table has only one row                  | ‚úÖ‚úÖ‚úÖ      |



- Access Type = `ALL`
- Means MySQL reads **all rows** in the table (slow for big tables)

> ‚ÄúThis type is written in **ALL CAPS** because it's the most expensive.‚Äù

## üîπ Row Estimate and Filter Estimate
### üî∏ Estimated Rows:
> ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs estimated that 4046 rows will be examined‚Ä¶‚Äù

This means:

- The city table has ~4046 rows
- MySQL expects to **scan all of them**

&nbsp;

### üî∏ Filter Estimate:
> ‚ÄúIt's expected that 10% of the rows examined will match the where clause‚Ä¶‚Äù

- So, around 400‚Äì450 rows might match name = 'London' (even if that's not true).
- This is only an estimate based on internal stats.

> [!WARNING]
> MySQL uses default heuristics if no index/statistics are available ‚Äî don‚Äôt rely on this for accuracy.


&nbsp;

## üîπ Formats of EXPLAIN Output
MySQL supports 3 output formats:

| Format          | Description                    | Use Case                      |
| --------------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| **Traditional** | Tabular rows (default)         | Quick checks, human-readable  |
| **JSON**        | Rich details in JSON structure | Best for tools, scripting     |
| **TREE**        | Hierarchical execution steps   | Best for visual understanding |

> ‚ÄúThe tree style is the newest format ‚Ä¶ shows execution order and relationships.‚Äù

---

## üîπ Tree Format and EXPLAIN ANALYZE

> ‚ÄúThe tree format is also the default for EXPLAIN ANALYZE as of MySQL 8.0.18.‚Äù

### üî∏ Example:

```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM city WHERE name = 'London';
```

This actually runs the query and:
- Shows which parts took more/less time
- Displays how many rows were returned from each step

```pgsql
-> Filter: (city.`Name` = 'London')  (cost=411 rows=405) (actual time=0.352..1.92 rows=2 loops=1)
     -> Table scan on CITY  (cost=411 rows=4046) (actual time=0.138..1.57 rows=4079 loops=1)
 
```

# üîπ Understanding Tree Output Structure
> ‚ÄúThe output is organized into a series of nodes‚Ä¶‚Äù

#### Think of it like a tree:
- Leaf Nodes: Actual scans (e.g., full table scan, index scan)
- Parent Nodes: Filtering, sorting, joining, etc.


So the steps are:

- Read all rows from city table
- Apply WHERE name = 'Cairo' filter



## üîπ Estimated vs Actual Costs
> ‚ÄúThe estimation cost is represented in internal MySQL units‚Ä¶‚Äù

You might see output like:

```json
"cost_info": {
    "query_cost": 37.50,
    "read_cost": 30,
    "eval_cost": 7.5
}
```

###  üî∏ What does this mean?
- These are not milliseconds
- MySQL assigns a ‚Äúcost‚Äù value to each operation
   - Reading from disk: cost = 2
   - Reading from memory: cost = 1

- They help the optimizer compare possible plans ‚Äî lower cost is better.

&nbsp;

## üîπ Actual Execution Timing
 > ‚ÄúThe first row was read in about 4 milliseconds‚Ä¶ all rows in roughly 5ms‚Äù

You may see this in output:

```json
"actual_time": {
  "first_row": 4.2,
  "last_row": 5.1
}
```


###  üî∏ What does this mean?

- **First match** found after 4ms
- **All data** processed in 5ms

‚úÖ Efficient for small tables, even with full scans
‚ùå But will be much slower with larger data

&nbsp;

### üîπ Loops = Number of Executions
> ‚ÄúThere was a single loop for this query because there was no join‚Ä¶‚Äù

This means:
- MySQL only ran this sub-step once
- If there was a JOIN, you'd see nested loops
